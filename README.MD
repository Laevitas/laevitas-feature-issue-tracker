## Laevitas Feature/Issue Reporting Guidelines

### Welcome to the Feature/Issue Tracker!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our projects. Before you create a new issue, please take a moment to read through these guidelines to ensure effective communication and streamline issue management.

This feature/issue tracker is designed to streamline feature request, bug reporting and issue management for the following projects:
1.  **API**: The API gateway serves clients with REST API endpoints.
2.  **Dashboard**: The web-based dashboard.

### Feature/Issue Title

When creating an issue, the title should be concise, descriptive, and specific, including the context of the project. A good issue title helps others understand the problem at a glance and helps with issue categorization. Here are some tips for writing an effective issue title:

1.  **Include Project Context**: Start the title with the name of the project followed by a colon (:) to indicate which project the issue pertains to.
    
2.  **Be Specific**: Clearly indicate the problem or feature you are addressing. Avoid vague titles that don't provide enough information.
    
3.  **Use Keywords**: Include keywords that describe the issue, such as "bug," "enhancement," "feature request," etc.
    
4.  **Summarize the Feature/Issue**: Keep the title short while still capturing the essence of the problem or request.
    

**Example Titles:**

-   ✅ **API**: Bug - Unable to authenticate with API-gateway using SDK
-   ✅ **Dashboard**: Feature Request - Add pagination to dashboard table
-   ✅ **API**: Enhancement - Improve error handling for endpoints

### Issue Description

In the issue description, provide detailed information about the problem or feature request. Be clear and concise in your explanation, and include the following details:

1.  **Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)**: If you are reporting a bug, include step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue. This helps developers identify and fix the problem quickly.
    
2.  **Expected Behavior (for bugs)**: Describe what you expected to happen when encountering the issue.
    
3.  **Actual Behavior (for bugs)**: Explain what is currently happening, which indicates the problem.
    
4.  **Context (for bugs and feature requests)**: Provide any additional context that may help understand the issue better. This could include relevant environment details, affected versions, or any related information.
    
5.  **Proposed Solution (for feature requests)**: If you're suggesting a new feature, outline your proposed solution and its potential benefits.
    

### Labels and Assignees

To help categorize and prioritize issues, use labels and assignees as appropriate. Labels can include "bug," "enhancement," "feature request," "documentation," etc. Assign the issue to a specific person or team responsible for addressing it.

### Additional Information

-   **Attachments**: Feel free to attach relevant files, screenshots, or other materials that can help illustrate the issue or proposed feature.
    
-   **Discuss First**: Before creating an issue, consider discussing the matter on our communication channels, such as Discord or Gitter, to get feedback from the community.
    

### Be Courteous and Respectful

Remember, our community values respect and collaboration. When interacting with others in issue discussions, maintain a positive and constructive tone.
